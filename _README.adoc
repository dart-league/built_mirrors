This is a library that generates `ClassMirror` from classes annotated with
`@reflectable` or `@Reflectable()`.

=== Getting Started

1 - Create a new dart-web project.
2 - add `built_mirrors` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`.

[source,yaml]
----
...
dependencies:
#  ...
  # replace for the latest version
  built_mirrors: any
#  ...
dev_dependencies:
#  ...
  # replace for the latest version
  built_runner: any
#  ...
----

3 - create a file in `bin` folder called `models.dart` and put next code on it:


[source, dart]
----
include::example/bin/models.dart[]
----

4 - edit the file `main.dart` in the folder `bin` and put next code on it:

[source, dart]
----
include::example/bin/main.dart[]
----

5 - run `dart run build_runner build`. Then you will see that the files `bin/models.g.dart`
and `bin/main.g.dart` have been generated and they will contain the next code:

[source, dart]
----
include::example/bin/main.g.dart[]
----

and:

[source, dart]
----
include::example/bin/models.g.dart[]
----

6 - Finally you can run the file `bin/main.dart` and if everything is ok you will see next
output in console:

[source]
---------------------------
p1Fields['myDynamic'].type: dynamic

p1Fields['cars'].type: [List, Car]

car1:
	id: 1
	engine: v8


--------------------------
reflecting "ClassWithMethod"
--------------------------
(someMethod, someMethodWithNamedParams)
dynamic
[Instance of '_MyOtherAnnotation']
[DeclarationMirror on someParameter]
[Instance of '_MyOtherAnnotation']
String

--------------------------
reflecting "someFunction"
--------------------------
someFunction
String
[Instance of 'AnnotationWithFunction']
[DeclarationMirror on p1, DeclarationMirror on p0, DeclarationMirror on p2]
[Instance of '_MyOtherAnnotation']
int
p1
p0
p2
---------------------------
